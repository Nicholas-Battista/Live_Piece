# Live_Piece

This is a project I will continue to update as I progress on my journey to become a web developer - Nicholas B 9/22/23.

1. Welcome, as of now I have a brief understanding of HTML and CSS, I have created a webpage titled "Live Piece" though the name may change in the future haha. As of now the page has a dynamic navbar, animated titles, and an embedded youtube link. With some style added to it.
2. I plan to add more interactivity to this page and make it the best I can in the time to come. Ideally it will show the next episode preview of one piece each week (upadted automatically),
3. show news related to one piece, tweets, alerts, etc (all automated),
4. as well as show links to the most up to date manga chapters and anime episodes.

5. wishing myself luck in the jouney ahead --- Nicholas B 9/22/23.
